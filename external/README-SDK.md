# SDK Dependency Required

This folder is intentionally left empty in the repository.
To build RedBoxIO, you must manually place the required Steinberg ASIO SDK files here.

See the main [README](../README.md#required-dependencies-steinberg-asio-sdk--focusrite-control) for download instructions and a list of required files.
